        <h3>Fruits</h3>
        <p>Fruits are naturally sweet and nutritious foods that come from flowering plants. They are typically rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and dietary fiber. Fruits vary widely in flavor, texture, and appearance, from juicy berries (such as strawberries and blueberries) to tropical delights (like mangoes and pineapples) and citrus fruits (such as oranges and lemons). Fruits are enjoyed fresh, dried, or used in various culinary applications, desserts, and beverages.</p>

        <h3>Juices</h3>
        <p>Juices are beverages made by extracting the liquid from fruits or vegetables. They can be freshly squeezed at home or commercially processed and packaged. Fruit juices are refreshing and often consumed for their natural sweetness and vitamin content. Vegetable juices, such as carrot or beet juice, are valued for their health benefits and as a convenient way to consume nutrients. Juices can be enjoyed on their own or mixed into smoothies, cocktails, or other recipes.</p>
